      rev: `This movie just made my day a whole lot better. It is nothing but a masterpiece from Ufotable. The animation, the soundtrack, the music, the emotion is just amazing. I couldn't hold back my tears because of how much emotion there is in this movie. I would recommend this movie to everyone but PLEASE do your best to protect yourself from the coronavirus. The pandemic situation in my country is slowly escalating, but not severe. This movie might be released on Blu-ray or whatever so that you can watch it at home. It is your choice to either wait or go out right now. I am excited for the second season of this series and I can't wait to see what happens next. Stay safe!`,
