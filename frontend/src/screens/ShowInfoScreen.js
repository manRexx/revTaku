        rev: `This movie just made my day a whole lot better. It is nothing but a masterpiece from Ufotable. The animation, the soundtrack, the music, the emotion is just amazing. I couldn't hold back my tears because of how much emotion there is in this movie. I would recommend this movie to everyone but PLEASE do your best to protect yourself from the coronavirus. The pandemic situation in my country is slowly escalating, but not severe. This movie might be released on Blu-ray or whatever so that you can watch it at home. It is your choice to either wait or go out right now. I am excited for the second season of this series and I can't wait to see what happens next. Stay safe!`,

        rev: `The total series of demon slayer and this movie:Mugen Train have shown not only an energetic fight between demon hunters and demons but also an excellent touch of human emotions. Human bondings and emotions are prevalent throughout the series and the movie. The animation and sound tracks are no doubt superb. But the movie becomes very touchy bcos of Kyujuro Rengoku's death while fighting with Akaza....the end is saddening, makes the viewers cry.... At the end when Tanjiro shouts for the help to kill Akaza...the scenes are made in such a way as if viewers feel to come up to defeat Akaza. Mugen train is worth watching movie.Loved it.`,
